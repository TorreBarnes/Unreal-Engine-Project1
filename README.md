# Unreal-Engine-Project1
### This repository was created to house a self driven landscape project developed using the Unreal Engine (4.20).

__Project 1 was created using assets provided by Epic Games in the marketplace (Animation Starter Pack, Open World Demo Collection).__ I familiarized myself with basic concepts of the engine such as: 

- __maneuvering through and understanding the different panels of the UI__
- __utilizing height maps to generate vast landscapes quickly__
- __the strengths and weaknesses of various landscape tools__
- __materials and their production workflow in Blueprint__
- __creating material functions using Blueprint__
- __the pros and cons of using Blueprint versus using C++__
