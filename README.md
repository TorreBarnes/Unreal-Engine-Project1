# Unreal-Engine-Projects
A repository to house personal projects developed using the Unreal Engine

Project 1 was created using assets provided by Epic Games in the marketplace (Animation Starter Pack, Open World Demo Collection). I familiarized myself with basic concepts of the engine such as maneuvering through the UI, utilizing height maps to generate vast landscapes quickly, the strengths and weaknesses of various landscape tools, materials and their production workflow, and the pros and cons of using blueprint versus using C++.
