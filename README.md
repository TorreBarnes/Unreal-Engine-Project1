# Unreal-Engine-Projects
A repository to house personal projects developed using the Unreal Engine (4.20)

__Project 1 was created using assets provided by Epic Games in the marketplace (Animation Starter Pack, Open World Demo Collection).__ I familiarized myself with basic concepts of the engine such as: 

- __maneuvering through and understanding the different panels of the UI__
- __utilizing height maps to generate vast landscapes quickly__
- __the strengths and weaknesses of various landscape tools__
- __materials and their production workflow__
- __the pros and cons of using Blueprint versus using C++__
